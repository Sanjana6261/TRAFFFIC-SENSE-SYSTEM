# 🚦 Traffic Sense System

An **AI-powered Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System** built using **Python, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning**. This project analyzes traffic videos to detect vehicles, generate traffic reports, and visualize road congestion using heatmaps.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Traffic Sense System** is designed to support intelligent traffic management by processing recorded traffic videos. It detects and analyzes vehicles frame-by-frame and produces meaningful outputs such as traffic statistics and road heatmaps.

This project is suitable for:

* Smart city traffic analysis
* Academic mini / major projects
* Computer vision and AI learning

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To analyze traffic flow using computer vision
* To detect vehicles from traffic videos
* To generate traffic analysis reports (CSV)
* To visualize traffic density using heatmaps
* To demonstrate practical use of AI in traffic monitoring

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* 🚗 Vehicle detection using deep learning (YOLO)
* 📹 Traffic video processing
* 📊 Automatic traffic report generation (`TRAFFIC_REPORT.csv`)
* 🗺️ Road congestion visualization using heatmaps
* 🧠 Notebook-based implementation for easy understanding

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Deep Learning Model:** YOLO
* **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
